``fractopo`` is a Python library/application that contains tools for
validating and analysing lineament and fracture trace maps (fracture
networks). It is targeted at structural geologists working on the
characterization of bedrock fractures from outcrops and through remote
sensing. ``fractopo`` is available as a Python library and through a
command-line interface. As a Python library, the use of ``fractopo``
requires prior (Python) programming knowledge. However, if used through
the command-line, using ``fractopo`` only requires general knowledge of
command-line interfaces in your operating system of choice.

   Overview of fractopo

.. figure:: /docs_src/imgs/fractopo-visualizations.png
   :alt: Data visualization

   Visualisation of ``fractopo`` data. ``fractopo`` analyses the trace
   data that can e.g. be digitized from drone orthophotographs
   (=fractures) or from digital elevation models (=lineaments). The
   displayed branches and nodes are extracted with ``fractopo``.

Installation
------------

``pip`` and ``poetry`` installation only supported for ``linux`` -based
operating systems. For Windows and MacOS install using `(ana)conda <#conda>`__.

conda
~~~~~

-  Only (supported) installation method for ``Windows`` and ``MacOS``!

.. code:: bash

   # Create new environment for fractopo (recommended but optional)
   conda env create -n fractopo-env
   conda activate fractopo-env
   # Available on conda-forge channel
   conda install -c conda-forge fractopo

pip
~~~

The module is on `PyPI <https://www.pypi.org>`__.

.. code:: bash

   # Non-development installation
   pip install fractopo

poetry
~~~~~~

For usage:

.. code:: bash

   poetry add fractopo

For development, only ``poetry`` installation of ``fractopo`` is
supported:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/nialov/fractopo
   cd fractopo
   poetry install

Usage
-----

``fractopo`` has two main use cases:

1. Validation of lineament & fracture trace data
2. Analysis of lineament & fracture trace data

Validation is done to make sure the data is valid for the analysis and
is crucial as analysis cannot take into account different kinds of
geometric and topological inconsistencies between the traces.
Capabilities and associated guides are inexhaustively listed in the
table below.

For a short tutorial on use of ``fractopo`` continue reading:

Input data
~~~~~~~~~~

Reading and writing spatial filetypes is done in ``geopandas`` and you
should see ``geopandas`` documentation for more advanced read-write use
cases:

-  https://geopandas.org/

Simple example with trace and area data in ``GeoPackages``:

.. code:: python

   import geopandas as gpd

   # Trace data is in a file `traces.gpkg` in current working directory
   # Area data is in a file `areas.gpkg` in current working directory
   trace_data = gpd.read_file("traces.gpkg")
   area_data = gpd.read_file("areas.gpkg")

Trace data should consists of polyline geometries, i.e., of
``LineString`` type. Trace data in ``MultiLineString`` format area not
supported. Area data should consists of polygon geometries, i.e., of
either ``Polygon`` or ``MultiPolygon`` type.


Trace validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trace data must be validated using ``fractopo`` validation functionality
before analysis. The topological analysis of lineament & fracture traces
implemented in ``fractopo`` will not tolerate uncertainty related to the
topological abutting and snapping relationships between traces. See `the
documentation <https://nialov.github.io/fractopo/validation/errors.html>`__
for further info on validation error types. Trace validation is
recommended before all analysis using ``Network``. Trace and target area
data can be validated for further analysis with a ``Validation`` object:

.. code:: python

   from fractopo import Validation

   validation = Validation(
       trace_data,
       area_data,
       name="mytraces",
       allow_fix=True,
   )

   # Validation is done explicitly with `run_validation` method
   validated_trace_data = validation.run_validation()

Trace validation is also accessible through the ``fractopo``
command-line interface, ``fractopo tracevalidate`` which is more
straightforward to use than through Python calls. Note that all
subcommands of ``fractopo`` are available by appending them after
``fractopo``.

``tracevalidate`` always requires the target area that delineates trace
data.

.. code:: bash

   # Get full up-to-date command-line interface help
   fractopo tracevalidate --help

   # Basic usage example:
   fractopo tracevalidate /path/to/trace_data.shp /path/to/target_area.shp\
      --output /path/to/validated_trace_data.shp

   # Or with automatic saving to validated/ directory
   fractopo tracevalidate /path/to/trace_data.shp /path/to/target_area.shp\
      --summary

Geometric and topological trace network analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``fractopo`` can be used to extract lineament & fracture size,
abundance and topological parameters from two-dimensional lineament and
fracture trace, branch and node data.

Trace and target area data (``GeoDataFrames``) are passed into a
``Network`` object which has properties and functions for returning and
visualizing different parameters and attributes of trace data.

.. code:: python

   from fractopo import Network

   # Initialize Network object and determine the topological branches and nodes
   network = Network(
       trace_data,
       area_data,
       # Give the Network a name!
       name="mynetwork",
       # Specify whether to determine topological branches and nodes
       # (Required for almost all analysis)
       determine_branches_nodes=True,
       # Specify the snapping distance threshold to define when traces are
       # snapped to each other. The unit is the same as the one in the
       # coordinate system the trace and area data are in.
       # In default values, fractopo assumes a metric unit and using metric units
       # is heavily recommended.
       snap_threshold=0.001,
       # If the target area used in digitization is a circle, the knowledge can
       # be used in some analysis
       circular_target_area=True,
       # Analysis on traces can be done for the full inputted dataset or the
       # traces can be cropped to the target area before analysis (cropping
       # recommended)
       truncate_traces=True,
   )

   # Properties are easily accessible
   # e.g.,
   network.branch_counts
   network.node_counts

   # Plotting is done by plot_ -prefixed methods
   network.plot_trace_lengths()

Network analysis is also available through the ``fractopo`` command-line
interface but using the Python interface (e.g. ``jupyter lab``,
``ipython``) is recommended when analysing ``Networks`` to have access
to all available analysis and plotting methods. The command-line
entrypoint is **opinionated** in what outputs it produces. Brief example
of command-line entrypoint:

.. code:: bash

   fractopo network /path/to/trace_data.shp /path/to/area_data.shp\
      --name mynetwork

   # Use --help to see all up-to-date arguments and help
   fractopo network --help

Development
-----------

-  The package interfaces are nearing stability and breaking changes in
   code should for the most part be included in the ``CHANGELOG.md``
   after 25.4.2023. However, this is not guaranteed until the version
   reaches v1.0.0. The interfaces of ``Network`` and ``Validation`` can
   be expected to be the most stable.

   -  ``copier`` is a project templater. Many Python projects follow a similar

      files and configuration. ``copier`` allows creating a template project
      (e.g., https://github.com/nialov/nialov-py-template) which can be firstly
      cloned as the framework for your own package and secondly to pull updates
      from the template to your already started project.

   .. code:: bash

      # To pull copier update from github/nialov/nialov-py-template
      poetry run copier update


-  ``nix``

   -  ``fractopo`` is also packaged with ``nix``. ``nix`` provides
      declarative and immutable packaging which should make ``fractopo``
      last longer.

   .. code:: bash

      # To run the fractopo command-line using nix
      nix run github:nialov/fractopo#fractopo -- --help

-  ``pytest``

   -  ``pytest`` is a Python test runner. It is used to run defined tests to
      check that the package executes as expected. The defined tests in
      ``./tests`` contain many regression tests (done with
      ``pytest-regressions``) that make it almost impossible
      to add features to ``fractopo`` that changes the results of functions
      and methods.

   .. code:: bash

      # To run tests implemented in ./tests directory and as doctests
      # within project itself:
      poetry run pytest

-  ``coverage``

-  ``sphinx``

   -  Creates documentation from files in ``./docs_src``.

Big thanks to all maintainers of the above packages!
