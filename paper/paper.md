# Summary

In the Earth's crust within the bedrock, networks of planar discontinuities,
fractures, form intricate networks where they cross-cut and abut in each other.
The fractures themselves are important when considering the stability of the
bedrock in regards to e.g., earthquakes. Furthermore, the networks they form
are important pathways for fluid flow and subsequently, the transfer of
geothermal heat. The fractures can be observed from exposed bedrock surfaces
where the roughly planar discontinuities cut the bedrock surface forming a
two-dimensional fracture trace on the surface. Digitizing these fracture traces
from e.g., drone images of the outcrops results in georeferenced
two-dimensional fracture trace vector datasets, fracture networks, which offer
a window into the networks within the three-dimensional bedrock. To analyze
these datasets, common Geographic Information System (GIS) -tools can be used
to perform geospatial operations and analysis of the data. However, due to
specific requirements for geometric and topological consistency, it is
convenient for the user to have access to a common workflow for the data
validation and analysis, rather than implementing a geospatial analysis
separately each time for the data.

# Statement of need

The Python package, `fractopo`, provides the tooling for i) data validation and
ii) analysis of fracture network data (\autoref{fig:diagram}). The fracture
trace data is most commonly produced by manual digitization by a human.
Consequently, a number of digitization errors can occur in the data related to
geometric consistency of the traces (e.g., traces must not be multi-part) or
topological consistency (e.g., a trace can be interpreted to abut to another
trace only if it is within a certain threshold distance from the other trace).
To tackle the validation problem, `fractopo` uses the `geopandas`
[@jordahl_geopandasgeopandas_2022] and `shapely` [@gillies_shapely_2022] Python
packages to conduct a high variety of geometric consistency checks to find
topologically invalid traces that are the result of common digitization errors
which are then reported to the user as attributes of the trace data.

For data analysis, `fractopo`  the user can simply input the trace data along
with its associated digitization boundary to `fractopo`. The package can then
be called to return a number of analysis results in the form of
`matplotlib`/`seaborn` plots and as numerical data in the form of `numpy`
arrays and `pandas` dataframes. The results include e.g., rose plots of the
orientation of the traces [@sanderson_making_2020], power-law length
distribution analysis of the lengths of traces [@bonnet_scaling_2001],
cross-cutting and abutting relationships between predefined trace sets,
fracture intensities [@sanderson_use_2015] and topological ternary plots
[@manzocchi_connectivity_2002; @sanderson_use_2015] (\autoref{fig:montage}).
The package bears much similarity, and is inspired by, `NetworkGT`
[@nyberg_networkgt_2018] which first provided a workflow for analysis of
fracture trace data, including the determination of topological branches and
nodes. However, the tight integration of `NetworkGT` with `QGIS` causes the
package to be less friendly to development as it restricts the use of
`NetworkGT` strictly inside `QGIS` (or alternatively `ArcGIS`). In contrast,
`fractopo`, can be used anywhere with either the `conda` or `pip` package
managers as well as containing features absent from `NetworkGT`, such as the
determination of cross-cutting relationships between groups of fractures.

The usefulness of `fractopo` in research has been proven by its usage in two
publications [@skytta_fault-induced_2021; @ovaskainen_new_2022] as well as in
three Master's Theses [@ovaskainen_scalability_2020;
@jokiniemi_3d-modelling_2021; @lauraeus_3d-modelling_2021] and on a course,
*Brittle Structures in Bedrock; Engineering Geology* at the University of
Turku. Development continues actively and further academic publications are
ongoing.
