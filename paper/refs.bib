  abstract = {Fractures rarely occur individually but more usually as
    networks of numerous fractures whose arrangement, abundance, and
    interaction control the mechanical and transport properties of rock
    masses. Of particular importance are the distributions and spatial
    variations of different geometric (locations, orientation, length,
    etc.) and topological (intersections, connectivity, etc.)
    ­attributes of fractures in a network. Geographical Information
    Systems (GIS) provide a means to map and digitize two-dimensional
    fracture networks from a variety of field and remote sensing data
    and to display the results in the form of quality maps. We introduce
    NetworkGT, an open-source toolbox for ArcGIS capable of efficient
    sampling, analysis, and spatial mapping of geometric and topological
    attributes of two-dimensional fracture networks. The toolbox helps
    to extract and plot geometric and topological information from a
    given two-dimensional fracture network including: rose diagrams,
    plots of frequency distribution and topology, and maps of
    topological parameters. Using a fracture network example from
    offshore NW Devon, United Kingdom, we illustrate the practicality
    and effectiveness of the toolbox. This includes computing a contour
    grid with 1326 subsampled regions within the fracture network, which
    is used to demonstrate the quantitative capabilities of the toolbox
    and the ability to spatially map important network properties. The
    toolbox will help to facilitate the increasing application of
    geometry and topology in the analysis and comparison of fracture
    networks at a range of scales. Furthermore, the integration of the
    NetworkGT toolbox into ArcGIS allows two-dimensional fracture
    networks to be interpreted, mapped, and fully analyzed within the
    same software package.}

    discrete faults and the kine­ matically linked syn-fault extension
    fractures originate in crystalline rocks, and ii) how the resulting
    structural anisotropy controls the patterns of later-formed regional
    fractures. We recognized incipient faults with associated distinct
    damage zones (DZ; wall-, tip-, bend- and linking damage) indicating
    that faulting occurred within mesoscopically isotropic material
    devoid of pre-existing fabrics. Moreover, fault-induced extension
    fractures occur also outside the normal DZs indicating much wider
    DZs than that predicted by scaling laws. Extension fractures within
    the wide DZs are the result of linkage between sub-parallel segments
    of the dominantly sinistral and {\textasciitilde{}}N-S trending
    (sub-) vertical faults. The resulting syn-fault network of N-S,
    NW-SE and NE-SW trending fracture sets contributed to the mechanical
    anisotropy that controlled the patterns of the later-formed regional
    fractures. Specifically, i) narrow fault reactivation damage zones
    caused deviations in the patterns of otherwise systematic
    near-orthogonal regional fractures, and ii) the NNW-SSE trending
    regional fractures are poorly developed in areas where either
    several N-S faults or sub-parallel NW-SE syn-fault extension
    fractures are dominant. The latter applies in particular to a large
    left step-over zone between sinistral faults, which we infer to
    provide the first-order control over the development of contrasting
    fracture domains. The results of this study further indicate that a
    strike-slip paleostress event affected the crust after ca. 1.65 Ga.}

    within the Wiborg Rapakivi Batholith offers insights both into the
    brittle bedrock structures of the batholith and to the
    scale-dependence of lineament and fracture analysis results.
    Multiscale fracture studies from crystalline rocks are sparse even
    though brittle structures in the crystalline bedrock significantly
    affect the flow models of fluids, hydrothermal heat and
    hydrocarbons, and are the main factor controlling the permeability
    in crystalline rocks. The main goal of this study is to assess the
    scalability of lineament and fracture networks through statistic
    characterization of lineament and fracture datasets extracted from
    four scales of observation using geometric and topological
    parameters, and by studying the subsequent correlations between the
    dataset characterizations. The parameters are acquired from both the
    individual lineaments and fractures and from their respective
    networks. Brittle bedrock structures were extracted manually using
    two principle methods: lineament traces were digitized from Light
    Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models and fracture
    traces were digitized from drone-based orthophotography of bedrock
    outcrops. Both extractions result in two-dimensional datasets and,
    consequently, all characterizations of these datasets along with the
    scalability analysis results are limited to two dimensions. The
    crystalline Wiborg Rapakivi Batholith is structurally isotropic and
    lithologically sufficiently homogeneous so that the effect of both
    precursor fabrics and lithological variations can be ignored when
    considering the genesis and emplacement of brittle bedrock
    structures in the batholith. Scalability analyses conducted within
    this investigation revealed that the results of lineament and
    fracture network extractions are always dependent on the scale of
    observation. Even dimensionless parameters of networks, such as
    connectivity, were found to follow a scale-dependent trend: The
    apparent connectivity of a lineament or fracture network decreases
    as the scale of observation increases. The characterizations of the
    datasets were used for the interpretation of Wiborg Rapakivi
    Batholith fracture patterns and paleostresses, which could be
    compared to Olkiluoto site studies of paleostresses in southern
    Finland.}

  abstract = {The main purpose of this MSc thesis is to study the 3D
    geometry of secondary microfractures associated with faults by using
    grinding the tomography method. Information on the 3D geometry of
    microfractures can be used, for example, for predicting the
    hydraulic conductivity of rocks and for more accurate interpretation
    of generation mechanisms and kinematics of faults. A 3D model of a
    microfracture network of one oriented rock sample was constructed
    from data collected with grinding tomography methods. The
    interpretations made on the 3D model were compared with the field
    measurements and GIS fracture trace interpretations based on 2D
    orthophotography data collected with a drone and a digital SLR
    camera. The second purpose of this thesis was to compare these two
    scales of 2D fracture trace datasets and find out how the change of
    observation scale from meters to centimeters affects the 2D topology
    and orientation distribution of the fracture networks. The study
    area is located on the Island of Orrengrund, Loviisa, SW Finland.
    The fault studied in the thesis is a sinistral strike-slip fault
    with a vertical dip, and a N-S trend. In the grinding tomography
    method used in this thesis, a cylindrical 50*50*50 mm sample of rock
    is glued on a glass plate and grinded in slices with a 3D-grinder,
    so that after each slice the machine takes an image of the surface
    of the sample. When the images are combined by knowing the vertical
    position of each image, interpretations can be made on the observed
    fractures, and a 3D model can be constructed. In this thesis, a new
    GRN16 3D grinder of the University of Turku geology section was
    used. Grinding tomography images of the oriented rock sample were
    georeferenced on the orthophotos with QGIS software, so that the
    orientation data obtained from the 3D model of microfracture network
    was comparable with 2D fracture trace data and field measurements.
    The results of the thesis showed that the 3D model of microfracture
    network constructed using grinding tomography has almost perfect
    correlation with the orientation distribution and cross- cut
    relationships of field measurements. The study also revealed that
    the new 3D grinder of the University of Turku geology Section solves
    numerous problems regarding the use of the grinding tomography
    method in geosciences. In addition, topological differences were
    observed between the two different-scale 2D fracture trace datasets,
    reflecting that the topological properties of the fault’s fracture
    systems could be scale-dependent.}
