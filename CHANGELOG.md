# Changelog

## v0.7.0 (2024-11-1)

This release drops support for `pygeos` and Python 3.8 üêç following
upstream packages. This has resulting in code refactoring and fixes. No
new features.

### Bug Fixes

-   **analysis:** Topological plotting fixes
-   **cli:**
    -   Fix allow_fix option for `network tracevalidate`
-   **tval:**
    -   Improve stacked (`STACKED TRACES`) detection
    -   Handle empty trace geodataframe
    -   Handle split overlap error
    -   Handle flaky `shapely` overlap detection
-   Force return types for some flaky functions (convert to `float`)
-   Remove all `pygeos` references, i.e., stop using it as it is merged
    into `shapely`

## v0.6.0 (2023-12-14)

### New Features

-   **analysis:** Allow creating contour grids without determination of
    branches and nodes i.e.¬†topology
    ([854d1e03](https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/commit/854d1e034d932afba648bde25c41039cae6f7ccc))

### Fixes

-   **analysis:** Disable parallel processing on Windows due to
    instability
    ([614070fd](https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/commit/614070fd679e170126d40a0e66722ed92ae5853e))

## v0.5.3 (2023-05-09)

### New Features

-   A basic input geometry check is done before starting `tracevalidate` and
    `network` command-line invocations as suggested in
    <https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/issues/36>.

-   `joblib` cache settings can be set from environment
    variables.

### Fixes

-   (branches_and_nodes): Fixed `angle_to_point` by setting distance
    and similarity checks to more reasonable accuracy.

-   (general): Now crs is added before merging geodataframes in
    `dissolve_multi_part_traces`

-   (length_distribution): Handle empty arrays in in `powerlaw.Fit`
    invocations by returning `None` instead of a `Fit` instance.

-   (analysis): Length plot ticks are set explicitly in `setup_ax_for_ld` to
    avoid differences between Python package versions
    (<https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/issues/25>).

-   Z-coordinates are now *handled* across `fractopo` i.e. they do not raise
    errors. However, they are not guaranteed to be kept in results such as
    validated traces. Reported in
    <https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/issues/21>.

-   (analysis): Removed function signatures with mutable default arguments.

[`v0.5.2...v0.5.3`](https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3)

## v0.5.2 (2023-01-16)

### New Features

-   Add `plain` keyword argument to output less visualized rose and
    length plots.

### Fixes

-   Deprecated `CachedNetwork`.

-   Fixed typos in code.

### Build

-   Restructured continous integration and build structure.

    -   E.g. optimized *auxiliary* task runs on GitHub Actions and added
        a binary cache for runs.

### Docs

-   Added `./paper` directory with a manuscript describing `fractopo`.

Full set of changes:
[`v0.5.1...v0.5.2`](https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2)

## v0.5.1 (2022-11-28)

### Fixes

-   (analysis): Fixed XYI and branch ternary plot sample count to only report the
    valid node and branch counts.

-   (analysis): Fixed the cut-off vertical line to correspond to the
    actual cut-off rather than the lowest remaining length.

-   (general): Allow MultiLineStrings in `determine_valid_intersection_points`.

-   (analysis): Made sure the order of lengths used in plotting the fitted y values
    is correct in multi-scale length plots.

Full set of changes:
[`v0.5.0...v0.5.1`](https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1)

## v0.5.0 (2022-11-04)

### New Features

-   Implemented caching and parallel execution of expensive functions
    in `Network` analysis. This should speed up (repeated) runs on the
    same datasets. This implementation is based on `joblib` which provided
    the functionality without issue.

-   (analysis): Implemented plotting length data with the Probability Density
    Function (PDF) on the y-axis instead of Complementary Cumulative Number (CCM)

### Fixes

-   (analysis): Reported `CachedNetwork` deprecation

Full set of changes:
[`v0.4.1...v0.5.0`](https://github.com/nialov/fractopo/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0)

## v0.4.1 (2022-10-24)

### New Features

-   (cli): Save additional json data to output directory
    when running `fractopo network` for possible post-processing
    needs.

### Fixes

-   (network): General fixes to `fractopo network` command-line
    entrypoint.

-   Sort keys in any json output.

-   (network): Allow `MultiLineString` geometries when possible.
    Topologically non-valid data should be analyzeable with the
    best effort possible.

-   (branches_and_nodes): Fixes small logging bug.

Full set of changes:

    branches.

-   (general): Added `azimuth_to_unit_vector` function.

-   (analysis): Implemented rose plot functionality for non-axial data.

-   (analysis.multi_network): Added a ``MultiNetwork`` description function
    (`basic_network_descriptions_df`).

-   (analysis.multi_network): Implemented a rough first draft of a multi-scale
    length distribution fit optimizer using `scipy`.

### New Features

-   (analysis.multi_network): Added multi-scale azimuth set length distribution
    plotting.

-   (analysis.network): Implemented azimuth set length distribution
    plotting.

-   (analysis): Implemented a naive implementation of `Network` caching
    with `CachedNetwork` class. Errors will be raised if caching fails. User is
    recommended to fallback to `Network` in that case.

### Fixes

    is now set as a `tuple` instead of as `list` to avoid conflicts
    with string representations of the data in e.g. `GeoJSON`.
