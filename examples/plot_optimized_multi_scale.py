"""
Optimizing multi-scale cut-offs with ``fractopo``
========================================================

This functionality is very much so a **work-in-progress**. Optimization of a
power-law fit for continuous, "single-scale", data is easily handled by the
functionality provided by ``powerlaw`` but it does not directly translate to
the required methods for multi-scale data where normalization of the
complementary cumulative number (=ccm) has been done.
