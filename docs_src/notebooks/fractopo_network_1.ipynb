    "To visualize the spatial variation of geometric and topological parameter values the network can be sampled with a grid of rectangles. From the center of each rectangle a sampling circle is made which is used to do the actual sampling following [Nyberg et al. 2018 (See Fig. 3F)](https://doi.org/10.1130/GES01595.1).\n",
