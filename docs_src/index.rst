fractopo
========

|Documentation Status| |PyPI Status| |CI Test| |Conda Test| |Coverage| |Binder| |Zenodo|

``fractopo`` is a Python library/application that contains tools for
validating and analysing lineament and fracture trace maps (fracture
networks). It is targeted at structural geologists working on the
characterization of bedrock fractures from outcrops and through remote
sensing. As it is a ``Python`` library, the use of ``fractopo`` requires
prior (``Python``) programming knowledge.

   Overview of fractopo

.. figure:: /imgs/fractopo-visualizations.png
   :alt: Data visualization

   Visualisation of ``fractopo`` data. ``fractopo`` analyses the trace
   data that can e.g. be digitized from drone orthophotographs
   (=fractures) or from digital elevation models (=lineaments). The
   displayed branches and nodes are extracted with ``fractopo``.

Installation
------------

``pip`` and ``poetry`` installation only supported for ``linux`` -based
operating systems. For ``Windows`` install using ``(ana)conda``.

For ``pip`` and ``poetry``: Omit --dev or [dev] for regular
installation. Keep if you want to test/develop or otherwise install all
development python dependencies.

conda
~~~~~

Usage
-----

``fractopo`` has two main use cases:

1. Validation of lineament & fracture trace data
2. Analysis of lineament & fracture trace data

Validation is done to make sure the data is valid for the analysis and
is crucial as analysis cannot take into account different kinds of
geometric and topological inconsistencies between the traces.
Capabilities and associated guides are inexhaustively listed in the
table below.

Input data
~~~~~~~~~~

Reading and writing spatial filetypes is done in ``geopandas`` and you
should see ``geopandas`` documentation for more advanced read-write use
cases:

-  https://geopandas.org/

Simple example with trace and area data in GeoPackages:

.. code:: python

   import geopandas as gpd

   # Trace data is in a file `traces.gpkg` in current working directory
   # Area data is in a file `areas.gpkg` in current working directory
   trace_data = gpd.read_file("traces.gpkg")
   area_data = gpd.read_file("areas.gpkg")

Trace validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trace data must be validated using ``fractopo`` validation functionality
before analysis. The topological analysis of lineament & fracture traces
implemented in ``fractopo`` will not tolerate uncertainty related to the
topological abutting and snapping relationships between traces.
Therefore the trace validation is recommended before all analysis using
``Network``. Trace and target area data can be validated for further
analysis with a ``Validation`` object.

.. code:: python

   from fractopo import Validation

   validation = Validation(
       trace_data,
       area_data,
       name="mytraces",
       allow_fix=True,
   )

   # Validation is done explicitly with `run_validation` method
   validated_trace_data = validation.run_validation()

Trace validation is also accessible as a command-line script,
``fractopo tracevalidate`` which is more straightforward to use than through
Python calls. Note that all subcommands of ``fractopo`` are available by
appending them after ``fractopo``.

``tracevalidate`` always requires the target area that delineates trace
data.

.. code:: bash

   # Get full up-to-date script help

   fractopo tracevalidate --help

   # Basic usage example:

   fractopo tracevalidate /path/to/trace_data.shp /path/to/target_area.shp\
      --output /path/to/validated_trace_data.shp

   # Or with automatic saving to validated/ directory

   fractopo tracevalidate /path/to/trace_data.shp /path/to/target_area.shp\
      --summary

Geometric and topological trace network analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``fractopo`` can be used to extract lineament & fracture size,
abundance and topological parameters from two-dimensional lineament and
fracture trace, branch and node data.

Trace and target area data (``GeoDataFrames``) are passed into a
``Network`` object which has properties and functions for returning and
visualizing different parameters and attributes of trace data.

.. code:: python

   from fractopo import Network

   # Initialize Network object and determine the topological branches and nodes
   network = Network(
       trace_data,
       area_data,
       # Give the Network a name!
       name="mynetwork",
       # Specify whether to determine topological branches and nodes
       # (Required for almost all analysis)
       determine_branches_nodes=True,
       # Specify the snapping distance threshold to define when traces are
       # snapped to each other
       snap_threshold=0.001,
       # If the target area used in digitization is a circle, the knowledge can
       # be used in some analysis
       circular_target_area=True,
       # Analysis on traces can be done for the full inputted dataset or the
       # traces can be cropped to the target area before analysis (cropping
       # recommended)
       truncate_traces=True,
   )

   # Properties are easily accessible
   # e.g.,
   network.branch_counts
   network.node_counts

   # Plotting is done by plot_ -prefixed methods
   network.plot_trace_lengths()

Network analysis is also available as a command-line script but using the
Python interface (e.g. ``jupyter lab``, ``ipython``) is recommended when
analysing ``Networks`` to have access to all available analysis and plotting
methods. The command-line entrypoint is **opinionated** in what outputs it
produces. Brief example of command-line entrypoint:

.. code:: bash

   fractopo network /path/to/trace_data.shp /path/to/area_data.shp\
      --name mynetwork

   # Use --help to see all up-to-date arguments and help
   fractopo network --help

Development
-----------

-  **Breaking changes are possible and expected.**

-  For general contributing guidelines, see `CONTRIBUTING.rst </CONTRIBUTING>`__

Development dependencies for ``fractopo`` include:

-  ``poetry``

   -  Used to handle Python package dependencies.

   .. code:: bash

      # Use poetry run to execute poetry installed cli tools such as invoke,
      # nox and pytest.
      poetry run '<cmd>'


-  ``doit``

   -  A general task executor that is a replacement for a ``Makefile``
   -  Understands task dependencies and can run tasks in parallel
      even while running them in the order determined from dependencies
      between tasks. E.g., requirements.txt is a requirement for running
      tests and therefore the task creating requirements.txt will always
      run before the test task.

   .. code:: bash

      # Tasks are defined in dodo.py
      # To list doit tasks from command line
      poetry run doit list
      # To run all tasks in parallel (recommended before pushing and/or
      # committing)
      # 8 is the number of cpu cores, change as wanted
      # -v 0 sets verbosity to very low. (Errors will always still be printed.)
      poetry run doit -n 8 -v 0

-  ``nox``

   -  ``nox`` is a replacement for ``tox``. Both are made to create
      reproducible Python environments for testing, making docs locally, etc.

   .. code:: bash

      # To list available nox sessions
      # Sessions are defined in noxfile.py
      poetry run nox --list

-  ``copier``

   -  ``copier`` is a project templater. Many Python projects follow a similar
      framework for testing, creating documentations and overall placement of
      files and configuration. ``copier`` allows creating a template project
      (e.g., https://github.com/nialov/nialov-py-template) which can be firstly
      cloned as the framework for your own package and secondly to pull updates
      from the template to your already started project.

   .. code:: bash

      # To pull copier update from github/nialov/nialov-py-template
      poetry run copier update


-  ``pytest``

   -  ``pytest`` is a Python test runner. It is used to run defined tests to
      check that the package executes as expected. The defined tests in
      ``./tests`` contain many regression tests (done with
      ``pytest-regressions``) that make it almost impossible
      to add features to ``fractopo`` that changes the results of functions
      and methods.

   .. code:: bash

      # To run tests implemented in ./tests directory and as doctests
      # within project itself:
      poetry run pytest


-  ``coverage``

   .. code:: bash

      # To check coverage of tests
      # (Implemented as nox session!)
      poetry run nox --session test_pip

-  ``sphinx``

   -  Creates documentation from files in ``./docs_src``.

   .. code:: bash

      # To create documentation
      # (Implemented as nox session!)
      poetry run nox --session docs

Big thanks to all maintainers of the above packages!
