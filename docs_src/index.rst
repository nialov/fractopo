   Visualization of ``fractopo`` data. ``fractopo`` analyses the trace
   data that can e.g. be digitized from drone orthophotographs
   (=fractures) or from digital elevation models (=lineaments). The
   displayed branches and nodes are extracted with ``fractopo``.

Validating trace data
---------------------

Trace data must be validated using ``fractopo`` validation functionality before
analysis. The topological analysis of lineament & fracture traces implemented
in ``fractopo`` will not tolerate uncertainty related to the topological
abutting and snapping relationships between traces. Therefore the
trace validation is recommended before all analysis using ``Network``.

-  Introduction to trace data validation

   -  `Basics <validation/basics.html>`__

      -  See inside for usage example notebooks.

   -  `Error Types <validation/errors.html>`__

For trace validation also see `above guide <#trace-validation>`__ on
``tracevalidate`` command-line tool. After trace data validation, ``Network``
analysis can be conducted. Click on the links below for analysis examples
and guidance:

Analyzing trace data
--------------------

This Python module can be used to extract lineament & fracture size, abundance
and topological parameters from two-dimensional lineament and fracture trace,
branch and node data.

It is recommended to `validate the trace data <validation/basics.html>`__ first
before using it as an input for extracting branches and nodes. Otherwise the
extraction process might error out or result in invalid branches and nodes.

   topological network characteristics. Recommended for an introduction to
   fracture network analysis with fractopo. <notebooks/fractopo_network_1.html>`__
-  `Example scripts with resulting plots showcasing different analysis and
   plotting functionality implemented in fractopo. Recommended for overview of
   functionality. <auto_examples/index.html>`__
